This project is an attempt to imitate a particular human on IRC (in this case,
Nikky Southerland), who specializes in random snarky responses.  It's in a
very rough and unstable state at the moment, not that well documented and not
really in good shape for distribution, and not particularly well organized.
Hopefully this will improve with time.
