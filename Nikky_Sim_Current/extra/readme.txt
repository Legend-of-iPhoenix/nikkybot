Just for fun, I've included the original feature-complete TI-BASIC prototype
version of NikkySim that I started before creating the C version.  This was
originally going to be the released project, but towards completion, I wasn't
happy with the execution speed.  The excessive time needed to generate
sentences took too much of the fun out of it, which drove me to produce the C
version (which made other features like searching feasible).  It's a bit of a
convoluted mess of heavy-duty logic code, since I started writing it before I
came up with the more data-oriented branching table approach that I used in
the C version, but it might be interesting to someone.
