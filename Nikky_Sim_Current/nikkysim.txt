What is Nikky Simulator?
------------------------

Nikky Simulator is essentially a fun random sentence generator programmed
with vocabulary intended to somewhat impersonate the character Nikky
Southerland who is so infamous in the TI calculator community.  It started as
one of those random ideas that came from seemingly nowhere.  The seed used
for the pseudorandom number generator can be selected so that it is possible
to return to a particular saying later.  It also offers the ability to save
bookmarks (seeds) for later retrieval and search through seeds for a given
word or phrase.



Installing and starting the simulator
-------------------------------------

Installation is the same as with most other modern TTPacked programs.  Send
the appropriate 'nikky' and 'nikkyppg' files to your calculator--.89y and .89y
for TI-89 and TI-89 Titanium, .9xy and .9xz for TI-92 Plus, .v2y and .v2z for
Voyage 200.  Actually, it shouldn't really matter which model's files you
send; the versions are intercompatible across calculators.  Put both files in
the same directory, set that directory as the current directory using the MODE
screen or the setFold command, and execute the 'nikky' ASM file.  That's
pretty much it.



Usage
-----

The main screen contains a header at the top displaying the current saying
number, the main area displaying the randomly generated saying, and a help
bar at the bottom labeling the F-keys.  The saying number has three parts.
The first part is a letter indicating the pseudorandom number algorithm in
use (‘A’ for the original native routines used by Nikky Simulator v0.00.00,
‘B’ for the Mersenne Twister algorithm introduced in v0.10.00).  The two
remaining parts relate to the state of the random number generator.  A
particular number will always generate the same particular saying.  This way
if you find a saying you like, you can easily return to it later by going back
to that saying number.

Key functions are as follows:

    - Cursor up/down/left/right:  Navigate through the sayings.  Up and down
      change the first part of the saying number; left and right change the
      second.
      
    - [ENTER]:  Page down, if the saying is too long to fit on one screen. 
      Pressing again on the last screen of the saying returns back to the
      beginning.
      
    - [STO]:  Bookmark the currently displayed saying (including the current
      random number algorithm).   This will add the saying number to a list
      for later retrieval.  A dialog box appears where you can give the saying
      a name if you want.  If you choose not to, an excerpt from the saying is
      used as a default name.
      
    - [F1]:  Display a dialog box giving a brief list of the keys available
      and their functions.
    
    - [F2]:  Display the list of bookmarks.  Bookmarks are listed by the names
      they were given when they were saved.  Select a bookmark to display
      another menu with the three options “Open”, “Edit name…”, and “Delete…”.
      “Open” jumps to the saying number recorded in the bookmark and displays
      the saying.  “Edit name…” displays a dialog box allowing you to change
      the name given to the bookmark.  “Delete…” permanently removes a
      bookmark from the list (a confirmation dialog will ask you if you're
      sure--press [ENTER] to delete, [ESC] to cancel).
      
    - [F8]:  Display the search dialog box.  This allows entering parameters
      for searching sayings.  Sayings will be generated in turn until either
      a match is found or the operation is manually interrupted (press [ON]
      during the search process to do this).  Enter the word or phrase to
      search for (case insensitive) and the search direction.  The options are
      to search while incrementing the first part of the saying number,
      incrementing the second part, decrementing the first part, and
      decrementing the last part.  Confirm the dialog box to begin the search.
      
    - [F3]:  Immediately repeat the search using the parameters last entered
      in the [F8] search dialog, looking for the next match.  (If no search
      was entered yet, the dialog is presented first.)
      
    - [F4]:  Randomly select one of the two random number algorithms and then
      jump to a random saying number.  The resulting saying will be displayed
      immediately.
      
    - [F5]:  Go to a given saying number.  The number is entered in the
      dialog box as it is displayed:  two integers separated with a hyphen,
      for example, 1234-567.
      
    - [F6]:  Displays author and license information for Nikky Simulator.
    
    - [F7]:  Toggles random number algorithms (the ‘A’ and ‘B’ parts of the
      saying number).  Each algorithm generates a unique sequence of random
      numbers, resulting in different sayings.  The ‘B’ (Mersenne Twister)
      algorithm is theoretically more random than the ‘A’ (original) one, but
      searching is also much slower.
      
    - [CUT] ([Diamond]+[X] on TI-92+/V200):  Copy the current saying to the
      AMS clipboard.  It can then be later pasted into the standard text editor
      and the like.
      
    - [COPY] ([Diamond]+[C] on the TI-92+/V200):  Append the current saying to the
      current clipboard.  The saying will be added to the end of the text the
      clipboard currently holds.  This can be done for several sayings, then they
      can later be pasted all in one batch.
    
    - [ESC] or [2nd]+[QUIT]:  Exit Nikky Simulator.
    
    
    
Bugs/limitations
----------------

My design goals for this program were to be able to create a wide variety of
types of sentences and sayings and to try to maintain at least mostly valid
grammar.  Given the complexity of the heuristics, it's entirely possible that
there could be some rare errors show up that I didn't catch.  Some wording
patterns are a bit awkward at times; these are mainly due to compromises I
made to prevent the logic from getting more complicated than I felt like
dealing with.

Low memory handling is not the best (not that that is one of C's strong
points, anyway).  I try to trap those and display an error instead of crash,
but if there isn't enough RAM to rewrite the 'nikkycfg' config file, chances
are good it will be corrupted and trash all your bookmarks.  Best to keep that
backed up somewhere and make sure there is plenty of RAM free when running the
simulator (preferably both).



Thanks
------

Guess I'd better thank everyone who participated in the development of TIGCC,
GCC4TI, VTI, TiEmu, TILP, and all the associated tools.  They are too
numerous to list, but none of this would be possible without them.

Thank you, of course, for trying it out.

And thanks to Nikky for giving me the inspiration for this project.  :)
