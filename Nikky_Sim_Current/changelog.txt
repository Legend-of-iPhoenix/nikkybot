   What's New

Release notes for Version 0.10.01
---------------------------------

Bug fix:

  - Accidentally introduced a bug where #↓-# search mode incorrectly looped
    back to X-32767 instead of X-9999.
   
   
   
Release notes for Version 0.10.00
---------------------------------

Features:

  - New Mersenne Twister pseudorandom number algorithm introduced to
    hopefully make up for some of the apparent deficiencies of the routines
    used by the GCC4TI stdlib.h.  The old PRNG is still available so that
    bookmarks created with the previous version are still accessible.  New
    bookmarks will automatically keep track of which PRNG is used and select
    it when opened.  No action needs to be taken to upgrade; the old config
    file will still be recognized and opened as before.
    
  - Source code changes to build a simple PC command-line version of the
    simulator using the Mersenne Twister PRNG.  This generates the same
    “B-” sayings as the on-calc version.  (The original PRNG is not supported
    since I have no idea what its algorithm/implementation is.)  Great for
    searching for sayings and such--much faster than on the calc.
    
  - Added ability to copy sayings to the clipboard.  This way they can be
    exported easily.  This is the recommended approach for archiving sayings,
    since it is impossible to guarantee that a particular saying number will
    always yield the same saying in future releases--every little change to
    anything will potentially change the generated sayings completely.  That's
    just the nature of the PRNG mathematics.
    
    
Miscellaneous:

  - Help/about text now uses the same text-wrap display engine as the sayings
    (mainly done because I no longer had enough room to cram them into a
    dialog box, and I hate working out screen coordinates, anyway).
